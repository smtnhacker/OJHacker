# Checkers

The aim of this package is to provide an interface for the TC Generator in taking an input and generating test cases
with correct answers.

## Checker Template
```python
def typeNum(inputs)
    '''
        Function that solves the problem and returns it as a string

        Parameters:
            inputs (string) := input string

        Returns:
            output (string) :=  output string
    '''

    return correct_output
```

## Example
```python
def pa04(inp):
    return "hatd0g, it worked!"
```
